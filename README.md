# Data Processing and Storage Assignment

## Overview
This project implements an in-memory key-value database with transaction support. Transactions allow “all or nothing” updates to databases to prevent dirty writes. Features include begin_transaction, put, get, commit, and rollback, which are essential for managing consistent state in the database.

## Instructions
1. Install Python.
2. Clone the repository or download inmemorydb.py to your local machine.
3. If you want to test the example usage provided in the instructions, uncomment the `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block in inmemorydb.py.
4. Run `python inmemorydb.py`.

## Future Improvements
To make this assignment more effective and easier to grade in the future, consider including an example test file or providing a requirement for students to create a test script to validate the database functionality. The assignment could explain how to create a test file and how to run it. Including a basic test script or requiring the main function to demonstrate all the methods in action gives clarity and allows for consistent grading. For example, the commented out main functionality in my inmemorydb.py file could be provided as a starting point for testing!
